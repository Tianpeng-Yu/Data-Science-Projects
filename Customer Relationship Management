# Since we are trying to determine which factor is most determinant |(and therefore better suited for the investment of $1.5 million) 
# in convincing painters to swtich to JD, we should use a logistic  |
# regression to determine the influences and most profitable scheme |

# After spending the 5 million, we can expect the probability of a customer purchasing JD, is 0.3878

# Since JD can spend up to $1.5 million, there are three options that could occur:
# (1) Every additional second on average is $55,000... That translated to an increase of 27.27 seconds on average
# (2) At $800k for each additional sie on average, you can increase the average site on average by 1.875
# (3) 1 full star increase costs $1.25 million, meaning a 1.2 start increase 

newdata2 <- data.frame(Seconds_Ad_Watched=37.27,Searched_Product=2.875,Overall_Reviews=4.2)
predict(logit1, newdata = newdata2, type = 'response')
# The above prediction represents the outcome if JD were to invest in ALL the options, with a P=0.9848..

# Now let's compare between the options (we can also use logodds and exp())

predict(logit1, newdata = newdata_third, type = 'response')

# As we can observe from the above, spending the $1.5 million in increasing their online rating would yield |
# the highest probability that a customer would, on average, switch to JD. 

# From Homework 1, Problem 4, we gathered that the market in which JD operates has 600 painters,
# and that the CLV is 166,859. That is probably why it is so expensive to acquire a new customer,
# the retention rate is really high. Based on the current market share of JD, 9.6% of the market,
# we can determine that there are about 442 painters left in the area that do not work with JD.
clv <- 166859

# Calculation of remaining painters in the market
marketsize <- 600-round((2.2/23)*600)
# Therefore, the total benefit from spending the total $6.5 million is...

switchers <- res1 *marketsize
CLVswitchers <- clv*switchers
CLVswitchers
Net_Value <- CLVswitchers - 6500000
Net_Value
# The investment will return an expected value of $68,934,579 conditional on the prediction of the 
# extra $1.5 million invested in pursuing the third option: increasing the rating. 
# Therefore the net value is 62434579
