# Since we are trying to determine which factor is most determinant |(and therefore better suited for the investment of $1.5 million) 
# in convincing painters to swtich to JD, we should use a logistic  |
# regression to determine the influences and most profitable scheme |

# After spending the 5 million, we can expect the probability of a customer purchasing JD, is 0.3878

# Since JD can spend up to $1.5 million, there are three options that could occur:
# (1) Every additional second on average is $55,000... That translated to an increase of 27.27 seconds on average
# (2) At $800k for each additional sie on average, you can increase the average site on average by 1.875
# (3) 1 full star increase costs $1.25 million, meaning a 1.2 start increase 

newdata2 <- data.frame(Seconds_Ad_Watched=37.27,Searched_Product=2.875,Overall_Reviews=4.2)
predict(logit1, newdata = newdata2, type = 'response')
# The above prediction represents the outcome if JD were to invest in ALL the options, with a P=0.9848..

# Now let's compare between the options (we can also use logodds and exp())

predict(logit1, newdata = newdata_third, type = 'response')

# As we can observe from the above, spending the $1.5 million in increasing their online rating would yield |
# the highest probability that a customer would, on average, switch to JD. 

# From Homework 1, Problem 4, we gathered that the market in which JD operates has 600 painters,
# and that the CLV is 166,859. That is probably why it is so expensive to acquire a new customer,
# the retention rate is really high. Based on the current market share of JD, 9.6% of the market,
# we can determine that there are about 442 painters left in the area that do not work with JD.
clv <- 166859

# Calculation of remaining painters in the market
marketsize <- 600-round((2.2/23)*600)
# Therefore, the total benefit from spending the total $6.5 million is...

Net_Value <- CLVswitchers - 6500000
Net_Value
# The investment will return an expected value of $68,934,579 conditional on the prediction of the 
# extra $1.5 million invested in pursuing the third option: increasing the rating. 
# Therefore the net value is 62434579

###Predict Charges for Non-customers...
#Calcule IMR to remove selection bias...
Trip_Data$IMR <- dnorm(Probit_BW$linear.predictors)/(pnorm(Probit_BW$linear.predictors))

#Build a linear regression model to predict charges...

#Include IMR in the model to predict charges without selection bias...

NotBW_Updated$IMR <- dnorm(NotBW_Updated$zscore)/pnorm(NotBW_Updated$zscore)
NotBW_Updated$charges <- predict(Charges_bias_lm, newdata = NotBW_Updated)


###Calculate CLV\
alpha<-.7 #retention
OTA_Fee<-.3
Price_BW <- 332 #Price on TripAdvisor
Margin<-.5
Discount<-.1
Margin_Multiplier <- alpha/(1+Discount-alpha)

#Calculate CLV based on our current OTA position...
NotBW$CLV<-NotBW$prob*(Price_BW*(1-OTA_Fee)+NotBW$charges)*2*Margin*Margin_Multiplier

#Calculate CLV after updating the OTA position...
NotBW_Updated$CLV<-NotBW_Updated$prob*(Price_BW*(1-OTA_Fee)+NotBW_Updated$charges)*2*Margin*Margin_Multiplier

#Calculate final profit...
Profit <- sum(NotBW_Updated$CLV) - sum(NotBW$CLV) - 5000000

###Recommendation
#Since the new CLV is larger than the original CLV, and the profit is positive,
#We would recommend BW to purchase the first position.
